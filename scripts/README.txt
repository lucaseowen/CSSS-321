In this folder, I divided in different subdirectories all the scripts and RMarkdown files of the course.
In each subdirectory, you will find:

1 - lab_scripts: all the materials I have created for practice during quiz sections.
2 - presentation_scripts: all the materials for each quiz section module's presentations, inclduing a folder with images to knit the presentations.
